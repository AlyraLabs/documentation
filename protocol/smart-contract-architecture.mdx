#### Architecture

Alyra contracts are built using the **EIP-2535 Diamond Standard (Multi-facet Proxy)**.\
All execution flows go through the **Alyra Diamond** — a single-entry-point contract that delegates calls to specialized **Facet Modules**.

This design makes Alyra:

- **Modular** — new liquidity providers can be added as separate facets without redeploying the core system.
- **Upgradeable** — business logic evolves without changing the main contract address.
- **Deterministic** — all routes follow strict execution rules encoded in the **Execution Packet**.

Business logic lives inside Facet contracts, each responsible for interacting with a specific type of liquidity provider (e.g., bridges, DEXs).

#### Contract Flow

Example: a user swaps USDC on Ethereum for USDT on Arbitrum.

1. The signed **Execution Packet** is submitted to the **Alyra Diamond** contract.
2. Diamond validates the packet and forwards the call to the appropriate **Bridge Facet**.
3. The Bridge Facet encodes and forwards the transaction to the chosen bridge (e.g., Stargate).
4. Settlement completes on the destination chain exactly as specified in the packet, or reverts safely if constraints are violated.

#### Diamond Helper Contracts

Alongside the main Diamond, Alyra deploys helper facets to support:

- **DiamondCutFacet** — add, replace, or remove facet logic.
- **DiamondLoupeFacet** — query available functions and facet addresses.
- **OwnershipFacet** — manage contract ownership and permissions.
- **WithdrawFacet** — enable authorized withdrawal of fees or funds.

This setup ensures **upgradeability**, **transparency**, and **secure administration** without compromising the deterministic execution core.
