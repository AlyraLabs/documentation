title: "Custom Fees"
---

With Alyra, developers can not only access global cross-chain liquidity and execution but also earn revenue from every transaction processed through their integration.

Any dApp, wallet, or platform using Alyra’s API/SDK can define custom fees in bps (basis points) and automatically collect earnings from user transaction volume.

### How it works

When requesting quotes or executing transactions via the Alyra API/SDK, you can pass a fee parameter in bps: _1 bps = 0.01%_

Alyra adds this fee to the route, and it is distributed automatically via the Fee Collector infrastructure

**EVM**

Fees are accumulated in the Fee Collector contract. Only the designated fee wallet can claim accrued fees. Once a wallet is registered, all collected fees are locked to it and cannot be transferred. If you later change the fee wallet, new fees will accrue to the new wallet.

### Other networks (coming soon)

On Solana and Sui, fees will be sent directly to the designated wallet without requiring manual claims.

### Setting up a fee wallet

To start earning fees:

1. Register your integration at [portal.alyra.finance](http://developers.alyra.finance).
2. Link a wallet to collect fees.
3. Provide your String (so fees are tracked correctly.

Through the partner portal, you can monitor fees per chain and per token, and withdraw them.

### Configuring fees

You can configure fees in two ways:

1. **Global setup:** Define a fixed number of bps that applies to all transactions.
2. **Per-request setup:** Assign different fee values depending on transaction type, user group, or business logic.

   <Note>
     **Example**
     1. An integrator sets a fee of 30 bps (0.3%).
     1. A user makes a \$100,000 cross-chain transfer.
     2. The integrator earns \$300, which can be claimed via the Fee Collector.
   </Note>

### Key Benefits for Developers

- New revenue stream — earn from every transaction routed through your integration.
- Flexible configuration — set fees globally or dynamically per transaction.
- Transparent accounting — track fees by chain and token.
