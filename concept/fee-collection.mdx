title: 'Fee Collection'
---

With Alyra, developers can not only access global cross-chain liquidity and execution but also earn revenue from every transaction processed through their integration.

Any dApp, wallet, or platform using Alyra’s API/SDK can define custom fees in **bps** (basis points) and automatically collect earnings from user transaction volume.

### How it works

When requesting quotes or executing transactions via the Alyra API/SDK, you can pass a fee parameter in **bps**:

- 1 bps = 0.01%  
- 50 bps = 0.5%

Alyra adds this fee to the route, and it is distributed automatically via the Fee Collector infrastructure.

- **EVM networks (already supported):**  
  Fees are accumulated in the Fee Collector contract. Only the designated fee wallet can claim accrued fees. Once a wallet is registered, all collected fees are locked to it and cannot be transferred. If you later change the fee wallet, new fees will accrue to the new wallet.
- **Other networks (coming soon):**  
  On Solana, Sui, and Bitcoin, fees will be sent directly to the designated wallet without requiring manual claims.

#### Setting up a fee wallet

To start earning fees:

1. Register your integration at [**alyra.finance/developers**](https://alyra.finance/developers).
2. Link a wallet to collect fees.
3. Provide your **Integrator ID** so fees are tracked correctly.

Through the developer portal, you can monitor fees per chain and per token, prepare claim transactions, or swap/bridge collected fees into other assets.

#### Configuring fees

You can configure fees in two ways:

- **Global setup:** Define a fixed number of bps that applies to all transactions.  
- **Per-request setup:** Assign different fee values depending on transaction type, user group, or business logic.

---

#### Example

- An integrator sets a fee of **30 bps (0.3%)**.  
- A user makes a $100,000 cross-chain transfer.  
- The integrator earns $300, which can be claimed via the Fee Collector.

#### Key Benefits for Developers

- **New revenue stream** — earn from every transaction routed through your integration.  
- **Flexible configuration** — set fees globally or dynamically per transaction.  
- **Transparent accounting** — track fees by chain and token.  
- **Future-ready** — Solana, Sui, and Bitcoin support is on the way.
