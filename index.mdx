## Our Thesis

We believe the world is moving on-chain — but the foundational infrastructure behind it remains deeply fragmented.

Building any on-chain or cross-chain application today means dealing with a maze of incompatible systems: bridges, DEXs, aggregators, gas APIs, relayers, RPCs, token lists, and custom SDKs. Each protocol operates on its own standards, data formats, and security assumptions.

Even the most basic liquidity flow requires developers to stitch together multiple moving parts, monitor countless endpoints, and manage execution risks across several networks. It’s slow, fragile, and expensive.

Teams spend months building and maintaining routing, safety, and analytics infrastructure instead of focusing on user experience and core product. The result is systemic inefficiency — fragmented liquidity, unreliable execution, poor UX, high costs, and never-ending development cycles.

And yet, DeFi continues to attract tens of thousands of developers, drawn by its permissionless nature — anyone can deploy a protocol, integrate liquidity, or launch a financial primitive without gatekeepers. This openness fuels innovation but also multiplies inconsistency, exposing users and enterprises to hidden risks and non-deterministic execution.

Even traditional finance institutions exploring on-chain integration face the same barriers: overwhelming complexity, fragmentation, and the lack of a unified, verifiable way to execute transactions safely.

## Solution

Alyra is building execution infrastructure that enables any application to embed seamless cross-chain swaps and bridges through a single, developer-friendly API & SDK.

It aggregates, connects, and abstracts core financial infrastructure, sourcing liquidity from multiple decentralized exchanges, bridges, and aggregators, and unifies it under a single transparent execution framework.

Transactions move through verifiable smart contracts, ensuring that every step is deterministic and secure.

On top of execution safety, Alyra offers built-in monetization tools for integrators. Developers can configure custom fees per flow, allowing dApps, wallets, and fintechs to generate sustainable revenue from user activity without needing to build their own billing systems.

We also deliver analytics and reporting dashboards that track execution volumes, user flows, and liquidity usage in real time, helping teams understand performance and optimize for growth.

This lets builders — from fintechs and Web2 platforms to next-gen DeFi apps — focus on their core mission while drastically reducing go-to-market time, cutting maintenance overhead, and operating with institutional-grade safety and fault tolerance.

Alyra is designed to be the execution layer for the on-chain economy, removing integration barriers and the hidden risks that slow mainstream adoption of decentralized finance.
